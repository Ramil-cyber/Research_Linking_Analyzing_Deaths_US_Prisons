The 3rd City Mortality project tracks near-real-time data about individual deaths released publicly, along with metadata including data completeness and release speed, for (N=54) US state, federal, and Washington DC prison systems. Data released is often incomplete. Students will work both with mortality data already collected by the 3rd City team and linked data from public health data sources to understand data completeness and concordance of important elements, like cause of death. Students will help link prison mortality data between datasets, analyze findings from that linked data, and think and write critically about the meaning of linked and unlinked data, including its implications of this work for policy and advocacy.
